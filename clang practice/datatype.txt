Basic Data Types

The data type specifies the size and type of information the variable will store.

In this tutorial, we will focus on the most basic ones:
Data Type 	Size 	Description
int 	2 or 4 bytes 	Stores whole numbers, without decimals
float 	4 bytes 	Stores fractional numbers, containing one or more decimals. Sufficient for storing 7 decimal digits
double 	8 bytes 	Stores fractional numbers, containing one or more decimals. Sufficient for storing 15 decimal digits
char 	1 byte 	Stores a single character/letter/number, or ASCII values

Basic Format Specifiers

There are different format specifiers for each data type. Here are some of them:
Format Specifier 	Data Type 	Try it
%d or %i 	int 	
%f 	float 	
%lf 	double 	
%c 	char 	
%s 	Used for strings (text), which you will learn more about in a later chapter
