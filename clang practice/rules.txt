general rules
The general rules for naming variables are:

    Names can contain letters, digits and underscores
    Names must begin with a letter or an underscore (_)
    Names are case sensitive (myVar and myvar are different variables)
    Names cannot contain whitespaces or special characters like !, #, %, etc.
    Reserved words (such as int) cannot be used as names
